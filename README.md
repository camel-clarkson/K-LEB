K-LEB (Kernel - Linear Event Batches)

This is a kernel module designed to monitor hardware events from a kernel level.
It implements three key features: 
  1) The ability to send this event info back to user space
  2) The ability to keep the event recording process specific
  3) The ability to monitor events periodically with a high resolution kernel timer
