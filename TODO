3) Find fix to read testing
	a) Actually test to make sure it work correctly
4) Decide if I want to just store the data or collect it every 100ms-1s.
	a) Use double buffering?
	b) Figure out how to send at runtime the amount of data to pass to user.
5) Use the clock_gettime to profile it
	a) test it with a while(i<1000000000) loop

6) Get Lok's code working
	a) Make sure it is actually gathering HPCs correctly
	b) Make sure it is telling when the kernel is scheduling in and out

7) Implement Lok's code into mine
	a) Start code into my start code
	b) Stop code into my timer repeat code
